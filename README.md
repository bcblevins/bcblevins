## Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi, I’m Beau Blevins! I’m a creative and driven software developer who loves solving real-world problems with code. I started out teaching myself Python, and since then, I’ve built full-stack applications designed to make life easier and processes more efficient.  

From improving communication in veterinary medicine to creating tools that streamline everyday tasks, I focus on building projects that deliver real impact.  

Check out some of my work:  
- **VetRA** *(PostgreSQL/Java/Spring Boot/Vue.js)*: A patient portal for pet parents and their veterinarians.  
- **Date Stamp** *(JavaScript/Chrome Extension APIs)*: A browser extension developed for Companion Animal Hospital to add functionality to their practice management software.  
- **Kennel Map** *(PostgreSQL/Supabase/Vue.js)*: An application developed for Companion Animal Hospital to help streamline kennel processes.
- **DailyPlate** *(PostgreSQL/Supabase/React.js)*: A food tracking application focused on balanced nutrition.

I’m always learning, improving, and looking for ways to grow. Thanks for stopping by—I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!
