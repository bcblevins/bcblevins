## Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m Beau Blevins, a passionate software developer with a strong focus on solving problems. My journey began with self-study in Python, and I have since developed full-stack applications that tackle real-world challenges. Whether it's streamlining communication in the veterinary field or creating tools to optimize business processes, I enjoy building projects that have a tangible impact.

Feel free to explore my work, including projects like VetRA, a veterinary record-keeping system, Date Stamp, a custom solution for enhancing practice management software, and SuperSearch, a regex based text search tool. I’m always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I’m excited to share my coding projects with you.
